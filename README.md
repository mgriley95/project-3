# project-3

This project took data from the NYPD showing data of reported shootings from 2006 to 2022. This project shows trends in the data. The data was broken down into locations of the shootings across five boroughs, the demographics of the victims, and the time of day when the shooting occurred. The purpose is the show if there is any identifiable pattern which can assist police in determining where and when a shooting is likely to occur, and who the victim might be. 

In order to interact with this project, you will need to open it in Jupyter Notebook. From there the code can be viewed and the HTML files will show up as hyperlinks. You can click on the hyperlinks to interact with the graphs. 

In order to remain ethical while completing this project we used open source data that is available to the public. No personal information is used in the dataset The dataset is properly sourced and any code that is not original is credited to the original creator. 

The data source was located on data.gov and is from the NYPDâ€™s shooting data from 2006-2022.

Assistance in coding was done through the help of tutors and past assignments as well as  Stack Overflow. The charts and graphs for this project were done with Plotly.
